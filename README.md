## UX

### Main aims

- To create a website that promotes the society

- To provide a link to an application form for prospective new members.

- To make the website attractive and easy to use.

- To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes. 

### User stories

- As a new user, I want to be able to download an application form

- As a new user, I want to be able to send an enquiry about the society

- As an existing user, I want to see a schedule of the events

- As an existing user, I want to be able to check my handicap

- As an existing user, I want to check previous results

### Design Process

#### Design Process: UX Research 

I looked at several other sports websites to see what sort of design was popular.  From there I looked at the information
that I wanted to include and looked at how other sites dealt with this.

##### The following websites were used in the research process:
- [stagegolfingsociety.com](http://www.thestagegolfingsociety.co.uk/competition.html)
- [lucifergolfingsociety.com](https://www.lucifergolfingsociety.com/)
- [farmhousegs.co.uk](http://www.farmhousegs.co.uk/index.html)


## Features

### Existing Features

- This project consists of 5 pages, including a contact page and also a link to an external application form.
- The site should be responsive across all screen sizes with columns being hiden on smaller screens.


#### Consistent features across all pages

- The menu at the top of the page and footer are consistent in design and responsive throughout the website.
- The footer features a link to an external application form.
- I researched colours on trend for 2020, and ensured these colour schemes flowed across all pages.

#### Index

- I added an image that zoomed in when you land on the home page.
- Images that act as links through to other pages.

#### 2020 Championships

- An introduction to the society and the events that we hold.
- This includes a table with upcoming events, several of the columns are hidden on smaller devices.

#### Stats 

- A explanation on our handicap system is given to explain the system.
- A table showing all our members hadicaps and how they have changed based on the events they have completed.
Again the columns are responsive based on screen size.

#### Gallery 

- A gallery of images that resize based on screen size.

#### Contact us 

- A contact from including input fields, radio buttons and checkboxes.
